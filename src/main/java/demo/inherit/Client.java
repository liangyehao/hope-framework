 * Private Members in a Superclass
 *
 *  A subclass does not inherit the private members of its parent class.
 *  However, if the superclass has public or protected methods for accessing its private fields,
 * these can also be used by the subclass.
 *
 *  A nested class has access to all the private members of its enclosing classâ€”both fields and methods.
 *  Therefore, a public or protected nested class inherited by a subclass has indirect access to all of the private members of the superclass.
